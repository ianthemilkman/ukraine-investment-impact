We do not include the military equipment provided to NATO since this is not a direct flow into Ukraine (i.e. not a sovereign-to-sovereign flow). For the same reson, we do not include Luxembourg's contribution to the European funding of 250 million EUR, which refers probably to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (see ""Source of Aid 2"" and ""Source of Aid 3"" of the package from February 28).

In September 2022, during an interview with Spiegel, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that Poland donated 300 tanks in total (Source of aid 2). Since Poland previously donated 240 T-72 tanks and yet an unknown amount of PT-91 Twardy, we assume, based on this statement, that the amount of PT-91 donated is 60. Later in February, Polish Prime Minister stated the different amount of tanks donated, which was ""250 tanks... or even more than that"" (Source of aid 3). Since there is no other official source, we have to rely on the most recent information, which is 250 total tanks provided in total. We also assume that ""even more"" could not refer to a critical amount and thus stick to 250. Therefore, we decrease the amount of PT-91 to 10 (250-240).

The aid is part of a bigger package, the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2023 (Source of Aid 1) authorizing drawdowns of up to $3.7 billion, and the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2023 (Source of Aid 2), authorizing drawdowns of up to $14.5 billion. Since the USAA 2023 set the authority to $3.7 billion and the UASAA 2023 increases it to $14.5, we report the difference of $10.8 billion here.
